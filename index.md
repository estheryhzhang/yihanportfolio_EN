**Geospatial Risk Prediction of Motor Vehicle Theft in Chicago**

（Collaborator：Jessica Greene）

From the crime data published by Chicago Open Data, there were 9157 motor vehicle theft happened in 2017. Since motor vehicle theft has a correlation with unemployment rate and unguarded parking space, there is a reported surge of motor vehicle theft during the pandemic. Therefore, in this report, we tried to build a motor theft prediction model based on 2017 crime data and environmental risk factors.

Looking as the non-white to white arrest rate ratio in 2001, the top 5 crimes are gambling (6.451), robbery (5.733) , murder (4.933), stolen property (3.282) and motor vehicle theft (3.261)1. For these crimes, there are significantly more non-whites arrested than whites. Among property crimes, which includes burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson, motor vehicle theft has the highest non-white to white arrest rate ratio. From these data, we assume there might be a racial bias in motor vehicle theft policing.

Through our research, we found that motor vehicle thefts are more likely to happen in obsolete places, unguarded parking lots, car dealership and car repairs, where people tend to leave their keys inside.

In this model, we try to focus on the environments that is “unobserved”, or in Jane Jacobs’s words, places without “street eyes”. By focusing on physical environment itself and excluding racial and income context of the areas, we try to depict a “crime scene” rather than a crime socio-economic context.

Amsterdam is one of the earliest and largest market for Airbnb. Though the tourism industry and short-term/holiday rental helped Amsterdam to renovate and revitalize the historical district, the unregulated expansion brought serious problems to the local communities. By pushing out local businesses, driving up rental prices for short-term and long-term rental prices, bringing too much strangers and impolite tourists into residential neighborhoods, Airbnb is influencing the city and especially the communities in a negative way. With rising concerns Airbnb, the current public health condistion is seen by some cities as the opportunity to make a turning point for the Airbnb expansion.

We are developing an exploratory machine learning model to predict the annual revenue of a new Airbnb listing. The dependent variable Annual revenues are calculated by aggregating the price and occupant time for the whole year.

Our grander goal is to develop a integrated system which not only provide information about the predicted tax revenue, but also feedback and opinions about the new listing from community members. Our prediction about tax revenue and monthly occupancy will be sent to the community members to inform them about the activities and amenities that can be supported by the economic gains. Being fully informed about the pros and cons, they will report their opinions back to the government. Ideally, their opinions will be taken into consideration in the decision making process. But since we don’t have actual survey data from the community, this report will only focus on the algorithm of annual revenue prediction.

**Bikeshare Prediction, Boston**

（Collaborator：Jessica Greene, Brian Rawn）

[Click to see the full report](/projects/Bikeshare.html)

Rebalancing in bikeshare has long been a difficult task. There are always draining and spilling in different stations. Elavation, weather, holidays, events and the pandemic are all variables that affect peoples’ preference and commuting modes. The purpose of rebalancing is to determine how many bikes should be at a station at a certain time. One of the most important thing for bikeshare companies to do is to accommodate for the time and spatial pattern and redistribute bikes over different stations at a proper time.

The most manageable and efficient way seems to be using a truck to move bikes around. This mode is especially useful when there is a predicted surge of bike demand in certain areas during certain times, such as parks on sunny holidays and stadiums after a show. It can also used on a daily base to routinely move bikes from spilling stations back to the draining ones, assuming that the demand will also occur at certain time as usual. For stations that spilling and draining problems are not so severe or just occasionally happen, it would be good to offer people bonus or coupons for a suggested route or returning spots. Not by changing the customer’s destination, the bikeshare company could suggest a nearby returning station within walkable distance to the customers original destination, avoiding clustering of bike return in some hot spots.

Commuting patterns, holidays, weathers and events are some of the relevantly predictable factors in the supply and demand analysis. There will basically be different time scales for rebalancing in different scenarios. For daily commuting patterns, e.g. rush hours in the morning and afternoon, redistribution may happen by a day or half of a day. For holidays, weekends or special events, the stations with a predicted high demand should be prepared several hours before the spike come.

In this report, we are using historical bikeshare data from Boston (April 2018) to build a prediction model. The main features we took into account are timelags, holiday lags, weather, and spatial features including the location of the station, university areas, and possible hotspots such as parks, waters and parkways.

**California's Covid-19 Rent Relief Program Analysis of Application, as of April 24, 2022**

Research Brief | July 2022 | Housing Initiative at Penn

(Katharine Nelson, Cypress Marrs, Yihan Zhang)

[Click to see the full report](https://www.housinginitiative.org/californiarsquos-covid-19-rent-relief-program-july-2022-landing-page.html)

The federal government allocated nearly $50 billion to rent relief programs throughout the United States through the Treasury Department’s Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. In this report, we provide
an overview of the renters who applied to California’s COVID-19 Rent Relief Program, and a snapshot of
the status of those applications as of April 24, 2022. 

Key findings in the reports are:
1. One out of every ten renter households in California applied for rent relief through the California
COVID-19 Rent Relief Program. 
2. Most rent relief applications came from populous counties in Southern California and the Bay Area. These are all areas with moderate or high eviction risk.
3. Internet access and proof of tenancy documentation (e.g., a current rental lease) were critical barriers to participation in the rental assistance program.
